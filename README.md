# You Are Not a Mouse: Javascript library for mobile gestures

Just a fun and useful playground for now.


## Developing & Usage

See `index.html` for code examples.

Built with coffescript. To compile `swipe.coffee` while you edit it, run:

    coffee --watch --compile --bare swipe.coffee

You may then open `index.html` on a mobile browser to see/test your changes.

See http://tutecosta.com/notamouse from a mobile browser for a
demonstration. Swipe with one finger in four directions to move around
the red box.


# Forget about jQuery LightBoxes and small arrows, slide photos as if you were a human.
